# chemE-Tool
Authors : Bryce A Struttman, Heidi Snell.

Bryce took care of the coding, Heidi took care of the math.


This project was a test of Java skills as well as my ability to understand what should be basic chemical engineering concepts.
The java was easy, the chemE math was anything but.


The application takes two user specified chemical compounds, does a ton of math, and displays a table detailing the compound's interactions as the proportion of compounds changes.

There are a lot of ToDos on this project that should be done to improve it. They'll be detailed in the Issues.


The outcome of the program should look like this.
For non ChemEngineers this diagram details the interaction between two compounds as they evaporate into a closed system.
